## Variables revisited

In the last chapter I talked a lot about variables, how they’re assigned and some of the things you can do with them, but there’s a lot of additional complexities. That’s not a surprise of course. However, some of those issues are worth drawing your attention to now. So that’s the goal of this section; to cover a few extra topics. As a consequence, this section is basically a bunch of things that I want to briefly mention, but don’t really fit in anywhere else. In short, I’ll talk about several different issues in this section, which are only loosely connected to one another.

### Variable classes

As we’ve seen, R allows you to store different kinds of data. In particular, the variables we’ve defined so far have either been character data (text), numeric data, or logical data. It’s important that we remember what kind of information each variable stores (and even more important that R remembers) since different kinds of variables allow you to do different things to them. For instance, if your variables have numerical information in them, then it’s okay to multiply them together. But if they contain character data, multiplication makes no sense whatsoever, and R will complain if you try to do it:
```{r}
x <- 5 # x is numeric 
y <- 4 # y is numeric 
x * y
```
```{r, error=TRUE}
x <- "apples" # x is character
y <- "oranges" # y is character
x * y
```

Even R is smart enough to know you can’t multiply `"apples"` by `"oranges"`. It knows this because the quote marks are indicators that the variable is supposed to be treated as text, not as a number.

This is quite useful, but notice that it means that R makes a big distinction between `5` and `"5"`. Without quote marks, R treats `5` as the number five, and will allow you to do calculations with it. With the quote marks, R treats `"5"` as the textual character five, and doesn’t recognise it as a number any more than it recognises `"p"` or `"five"` as numbers. As a consequence, there’s a big difference between typing `x <- 5` and typing `x <- "5"`. In the former, we’re storing the number `5`; in the latter, we’re storing the character `"5"`. Thus, if we try to do multiplication with the character versions, R gets stroppy
```{r, error=TRUE}
x <- "5" # x is character 
y <- "4" # y is character 
x * y
```

Okay, let’s suppose that I’ve forgotten what kind of data I stored in the variable `x` (which happens depressingly often). R provides a function that will let us find out. Actually, it provides *several* different functions that are used for different purposes. For now I only want to discuss the `class` function. The **class** of a variable is a “high level” classification, and it captures psychologically (or statistically) meaningful distinctions. For instance `"2011-09-12"` and `"my birthday"` are both text strings, but there’s an important difference between the two: one of them is a date. So it would be nice if we could get R to recognise that `"2011-09-12"` is a date, and allow us to do things like add or subtract from it. The class of a variable is what R uses to keep track of things like that. Because the class of a variable is critical for determining what R can or can’t do with it, the `class` function is very handy.

Later on, I’ll talk a bit about how you can convince R to **coerce** a variable to change from one class to another. That’s a useful skill for real world data analysis, but it’s not something that we need right now. In the meantime, the following examples illustrate the use of the `class` function:

```{r}
x <- "hello world" 
class(x)
x <- TRUE
class(x)
x <- 100
class(x)
```

## Coercion

Sometimes you want to change the variable class. This can happen for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes when you import data from files, it can come to you in the wrong format: numbers sometimes get imported as text, dates usually get imported as text, and many other possibilities besides. Regardless of how you’ve ended up in this situation, there’s a very good chance that sometimes you’ll want to convert a variable from one class into another one. Or, to use the correct term, you want to **coerce** the variable from one class into another. Coercion is a little tricky, and so I’ll only discuss the very basics here, using a few simple examples. However, you'll see more examples of coercion as you go through this tutorial.

Firstly, let’s suppose we have a variable `x` that is *supposed* to be representing a number, but the data file that you’ve been given has encoded it as text (this happens quite a lot). Let’s imagine that the variable is something like this:

```{r}
x <- c("15","19")  # the variable
class(x)           # what class is it?
```

Obviously, if I want to do mathematical calculations using `x` in its current state, R is going to get very annoyed at me. It thinks that `x` is text, so it’s not going to allow me to try to do mathematics using it! Obviously, we need to coerce `x` from "character" to "numeric". We can do that in a straightforward way by using the `as.numeric` function:

```{r}
x <- as.numeric(x)  # coerce the variable
class(x)            # what class is it?
x + 1               # hey, addition works!
```

Not surprisingly, we can also convert it back again if we need to. The function that we use to do this is the `as.character` function:

```{r}
x <- as.character(x)   # coerce back to text
class(x)               # check the class
```

However, there’s some fairly obvious limitations: you can’t coerce the string `"hello world"` into a number because, well, there’s isn’t a number that corresponds to it. If you try, R metaphorically shrugs its shoulders and declares it to be missing:

```{r}
as.numeric( "hello world" )  # this isn’t going to work.
```

That gives you a feel for how to change between numeric and character data. What about logical data? To cover this briefly, coercing text to logical data is pretty intuitive: you use the `as.logical` function, and the character strings `"T"`, `"TRUE"`, `"True"` and `"true"` all convert to the logical value of `TRUE`. Similarly `"F"`, `"FALSE"`, `"False"`, and `"false"` all become `FALSE`. All other strings convert to `NA`. When you go back the other way using `as.character`, `TRUE` converts to `"TRUE"` and `FALSE` converts to `"FALSE"`. Converting numbers to logicals – again using `as.logical` – is straightforward. Following the standard convention in the study of Boolean logic, the number `0` converts to `FALSE`. Everything else is `TRUE`. Going back using `as.numeric`, `FALSE` converts to `0` and `TRUE` converts to `1`.

## Matching cases with `%in%`

Let’s start with a simple example. When my children were little I naturally spent a lot of time watching TV shows like *In the Night Garden*. In the `nightgarden.Rdata` file, I’ve transcribed a short section of the dialogue from the show. The file contains two vectors, `speaker` and `utterance`, and when we take a look at the data,
```{r}
load("./data/nightgarden.Rdata")
print(speaker)
print(utterance)
```


A second useful trick for extracting a subset of a vector is to use the `%in%` operator. It’s actually very similar to the `==` operator, except that you can supply a collection of acceptable values. For instance, suppose I wanted to find those cases when the `utterance` is either `“pip”` or `“oo”`. We can do that like this:

```{r}
utterance %in% c("pip","oo")
```

This in turn allows us to find the `speaker` for all such cases, 

```{r}
speaker[ utterance %in% c("pip","oo") ]
```

## Loading a CSV

### Importing CSV data (commands)

One quite commonly used data format is the humble “comma separated value” file, also called a CSV file, and usually bearing the file extension `.csv`. CSV files are just plain old-fashioned text files, and what they store is basically just a table of data. This is illustrated in the screenshot below, which shows a file called `booksales.csv` that I’ve created. As you can see, each row corresponds to a variable, and each row represents the book sales data for one month. The first row doesn’t contain actual data though: it has the names of the variables.

<img src="./img/csv_file.png" width=800px>

If Rstudio were not available to you, the easiest way to open this file would be to use the `read.csv` function. This function is pretty flexible, and I’ll talk a lot more about it’s capabilities in a later chapter, but for now there’s only two arguments to the function that I’ll mention:

- `file`. This should be a character string that specifies a path to the file that needs to be loaded. You can use an absolute path or a relative path to do so.
- `header`. This is a logical value indicating whether or not the first row of the file contains variable names. The default value is `TRUE`.

So, if the current working directory is the `Rbook` folder, and the `booksales.csv` file is in the `Rbook\data` folder, the command I would need to use to load it is:

```{r}
books <- read.csv(file = "./data/booksales.csv")
```

There are two important points to notice here. Firstly, notice that I didn’t try to use the `load` function, because that function is only meant to be used for `.Rdata` files. If you try to use `load` on other types of data, you get an error. Secondly, notice that when I imported the CSV file I assigned the result to a variable, which I imaginatively called `books`.^[Note that I didn’t to this in my earlier example when loading the `.Rdata` file. There’s a reason for this. The idea behind an `.Rdata` file is that it stores a whole *workspace*. So, if you had the ability to look inside the file yourself you’d see that the data file keeps track of all the variables and their names. So when you `load` the file, R restores all those original names. CSV files are treated differently: as far as R is concerned, the CSV only stores one variable, but that variable is big table. So when you import that table into the workspace, R expects you to give it a name.] Let’s have a look at what we’ve got:

```{r}
print(books)
```

Clearly, it’s worked, but the format of this output is a bit unfamiliar. We haven’t seen anything like this before. What you’re looking at is a *data frame*, which is a very important kind of variable in R, and one I’ll discuss later in this chapter. For now, let’s just be happy that we imported the data and that it looks about right.

### Importing CSV data (Rstudio)

Yet again, it’s easier in Rstudio. In the environment panel in Rstudio you should see a button called “Import Dataset”. Click on that, and it will give you a couple of options: 

<img src="./img/csv_import1.png" width=400px>

Select the “From Text File (base)...” option, and it will open up a very familiar dialog box asking you to select a file: if you’re on a Mac, it’ll look like the usual Finder window that you use to choose a file; on Windows it looks like an Explorer window. I’m assuming that you’re familiar with your own computer, so you should have no problem finding the CSV file that you want to import! Find the one you want, then open it. When you do this, you’ll see a window that looks like the one below:

<img src="./img/csv_import2.png" width=600px>

The import data set window is relatively straightforward to understand. In the top left corner, you need to type the name of the variable you R to create. By default, that will be the same as the file name: our file is called booksales.csv, so Rstudio suggests the name booksales. If you’re happy with that, leave it alone. If not, type something else. Immediately below this are a few things that you can tweak to make sure that the data gets imported correctly:

- `Heading`. Does the first row of the file contain raw data, or does it contain headings for each variable? The `booksales.csv` file has a header at the top, so I selected “yes”.
- `Separator`. What character is used to separate different entries? In most CSV files this will be a comma (it is “comma separated” after all). But you can change this if your file is different.
- `Decimal`. What character is used to specify the decimal point? In English speaking countries, this is almost always a period (i.e., `.`). That’s not universally true: many European countries use a comma. So you can change that if you need to.
- `Quote`. What character is used to denote a block of text? That’s usually going to be a double quote mark. It is for the `booksales.csv` file, so that’s what I selected.

The nice thing about the Rstudio window is that it shows you the raw data file at the top of the window, and it shows you a preview of the data at the bottom. If the data at the bottom doesn’t look right, try changing some of the settings on the left hand side. Once you’re happy, click “Import”. When you do, you'll see the `read.csv` command appear in the console, along with a `View(booksales)` command that will open up a visual display of the `booksales` data set.




## Formulas

The last kind of variable that I want to introduce before finally being able to start talking about something a little more  practical is the **formula**. Formulas were originally introduced into R as a convenient way to specify a particular type of statistical model (linear regression) but they’re such handy things that they’ve spread. Formulas are now used in a lot of different contexts, so it makes sense to introduce them early.

Stated simply, a formula object is a variable, but it’s a special type of variable that specifies a relationship between other variables. A formula is specified using the “tilde operator” `~`. A very simple example of a formula is shown below^[Note that, when I write out the formula, R doesn’t check to see if the `out` and `pred` variables actually exist: it’s only later on when you try to use the formula for something that this happens.]
```{r}
formula1 <- out ~ pred
formula1
```

The precise meaning of this formula depends on exactly what you want to do with it, but in broad terms it means “the `out` (outcome) variable, analysed in terms of the `pred`  (predictor) variable”. That said, although the simplest and most common form of a formula uses the “one variable on the left, one variable on the right” format, there are others. For instance, the following examples are all reasonably common

```{r}
formula2 <-  out ~ pred1 + pred2  # more than one variable on the right
formula3 <-  out ~ pred1 * pred2  # different relationship between predictors
formula4 <-  ~ var1 + var2        # a ’one-sided’ formula
```

and there are many more variants besides. Formulas are pretty flexible things, and so different functions will make use of different formats, depending on what the function is intended to do. At this point you don't need to know much about formulas - I only mention them now so you don't get surprised by them later!

<!--

## Generic functions

There’s one other important thing that I omitted when I discussed functions earlier on, and that’s the concept of a **generic function**. The two most notable examples that you’ll see in the next few chapters are `summary` and `plot`, although you’ve already seen an example of one working behind the scenes, and that’s the `print` function. The thing that makes generics different from the other functions is that their behaviour changes, often quite dramatically, depending on the `class` of the input you give it. The easiest way to explain the concept is with an example. With that in mind, lets take a closer look at what the `print` function actually does. I’ll do this by creating a formula, and printing it out in a few different ways. First, let’s stick with what we know:

```{r}
my.formula <- blah ~ blah.blah  # create a variable of class "formula"
print( my.formula )             # print it the normal way
```

So far, there’s nothing very surprising here. But there’s actually a lot going on behind the scenes here. When I type `print(my.formula)`, what actually happens is the `print` function checks the class of the `my.formula` variable. When the function discovers that the variable it’s been given is a formula, it goes looking for a function called `print.formula`, and then delegates the whole business of printing out the variable to the `print.formula` function.^[For readers with a programming background: R has three separate systems for object oriented programming. The earliest system was S3, and it was very informal: generic functions as described here are part of the S3 system. Later on S4 was introduced as a more formal way of doing things. I confess I never learned S4 because it looked tedious. More recently R introduced Reference Classes, which look kind of neat and I should probably learn about them. Discussed [here](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/R5.html) if you're interested.] For what it’s worth, the name for a “dedicated” function like `print.formula` that exists only to be a special case of a generic function like `print` is a **method**, and the name for the process in which the generic function passes off all the hard work onto a method is called **method dispatch**. You won’t need to understand the details at all for this book, but you do need to know the gist of it; if only because a lot of the functions we’ll use are actually generics.

Just to give you a sense of this, let's do something silly and try to bypass the normal workings of the `print` function:

```{r}
print.default( my.formula ) # do something silly by using the wrong method
```

Hm. You can kind of see that it is trying to print out the same formula, but there’s a bunch of ugly low-level details that have also turned up on screen. This is because the `print.default` method doesn’t know anything about formulas, and doesn’t know that it’s supposed to be hiding the obnoxious internal gibberish that R produces sometimes. 

At this stage, this is about as much as we need to know about generic functions and their methods. In fact, you can get through the entire book without learning any more about them than this, so it’s probably a good idea to end this discussion here.
