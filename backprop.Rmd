Earlier in these notes I used the [Rescorla-Wagner](./programming.html) model of associative learning as an example of how to implement computational models of cognition in R. In this and later sections, I'll expand the dicussion of models to cover a variety of other models in the field. I'll start with the **backpropagation rule** for learning in connectionist networks.
