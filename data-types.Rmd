## Factors

Okay, it’s time to start introducing some of the data types that are somewhat more specific to statistics. As every single research methodology class is at pains to ppoint out, when we assign numbers to possible outcomes, these numbers can mean quite different things depending on what kind of quantity in the world we are attempting to measure. In particular, psychologists commonly make the distinction between *nominal*, *ordinal*, *interval* and *ratio scale* data. How do we capture this distinction in R? Currently, we only seem to have a single numeric data type. That’s probably not going to be enough, is it?

A little thought suggests that the numeric variable class in R is perfectly suited for capturing ratio scale data. For instance, if I were to measure response time (RT) for five different events, I could store the data in R like this:

```{r}
RT <- c(1342, 1401, 1590, 1391, 1554, 1422, 1612, 1230, 998)
```

where the data here are measured in milliseconds, as is conventional in the psychological literature. It’s perfectly sensible to talk about “twice the response time”, `2 * RT`, or the “response time plus 1 second”, `RT + 1000`, and so both of the following are perfectly reasonable things for R to do:

```{r}
2 * RT
RT + 1000
```

And to a lesser extent, the “numeric” class is okay for interval scale data, as long as we remember that multiplication and division aren’t terribly interesting for these sorts of variables. That is, if my IQ score is 110 and yours is 120, it’s perfectly okay to say that you’re 10 IQ points smarter than me,^[Taking the usual caveats about IQ measurement as given, of course.] but it’s not okay to say that I’m only 92% as smart as you are, because intelligence doesn’t have a "natural" zero.^[Or, more precisely, we don’t know how to measure it. Arguably, a rock has zero intelligence. But it doesn’t make sense to say that the IQ of a rock is 0 in the same way that we can say that the average human has an IQ of 100. And without knowing what the IQ value is that corresponds to a literal absence of any capacity to think, reason or learn, then we really can’t multiply or divide IQ scores and expect a meaningful answer.] Similarly, we might be willing to tolerate the use of numeric variables to represent ordinal scale variables, such as those that you typically get when you ask people to rank order items (e.g., like we do in Australian elections), though as we will see R actually has a built in tool for representing ordinal data (ordered factors: discussed later) However, when it comes to nominal scale data, it becomes completely unacceptable, because almost all of the “usual” rules for what you’re allowed to do with numbers don’t apply to nominal scale data. It is for this reason that R has **factors**.

### Introducing factors

Suppose, I was doing a study in which people could belong to one of three different treatment conditions. Each group of people were asked to complete the same task, but each group received different instructions. Not surprisingly, I might want to have a variable that keeps track of what group people were in. So I could type in something like this

```{r}
group <- c(1,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,1)
```

so that `group[i]` contains the group membership of the i-th person in my study. Clearly, this is numeric data, but equally obviously this is a nominal scale variable. There’s no sense in which “group 1” plus “group 2” equals “group 3”, but nevertheless if I try to do that, R won’t stop me because it doesn’t know any better:
```{r}
group + 2
```

This doesn't make a lot of sense, but R is too stupid to know any better: it thinks that `1` is an ordinary number in this context, so it sees no problem in calculating `1 + 2`. But since we’re not that stupid, we’d like to stop R from doing this. We can do so by instructing R to treat group as a factor. This is easy to do using the `as.factor` function:^[This is an example of coercing a variable from one class to another. I’ll talk about coercion in more detail later]

```{r}
group <- as.factor(group)
group
```

It looks more or less the same as before (though it’s not immediately obvious what all that `Levels` rubbish is about), but if we ask R to tell us what the `class` of the group variable is now, it’s clear that it has done what we asked:

```{r}
class(group)
```

Neat. Better yet, now that I’ve converted `group` to a factor, look what happens when I try to add `2` to it:

```{r}
group + 2
```

This time even R is smart enough to know that I’m being an idiot, so it tells me off and then produces a vector of missing values.

### Labelling the factor levels

I have a confession to make. My memory is not infinite in capacity; and it seems to be getting worse as I get older. So it kind of annoys me when I get data sets where there’s a nominal scale variable called `gender` which is *supposed* to have two levels corresponding to `males` and `females`. Even setting aside the question of whether gender should be considered a binary variable in the first place (seems a little unlikely no matter how you define the concept of "gender"), it drives me crazy when I load the file and to print out the variable I get something like this:

```{r}
load("./data/badgender.Rdata")
gender
```

Okaaaay. That’s not helpful at all, and it makes me very sad. Which number corresponds to the males and which one corresponds to the females? Wouldn’t it be nice if R could actually keep track of this? It’s way too hard to remember which number corresponds to which gender. And besides, the problem that this causes is much more serious than a single sad nerd... because R has no way of knowing that the 1s in the `group` factor are a very different kind of thing to the 1s in the `gender` factor So if I try to ask which elements of the `group` variable are equal to the corresponding elements in `gender`, R thinks this is totally kosher, and gives me this:
```{r}
group == gender
```

Well,that’s...especially stupid.^[Some users might wonder why R even allows the `==` operator for factors. The reason is that sometimes you really do have different factors that have the same levels. For instance, if I was analysing data associated with football games, I might have a factor called `home.team`, and another factor called `winning.team`. In that situation I really should be able to ask if `home.team == winning.team`.] The problem here is that R is very literal minded. Even though you’ve declared both `group` and `gender` to be factors, it still assumes that a `1` is a `1` no matter which variable it appears in.

To fix both of these problems (my memory problem, and R’s infuriating literal interpretations), what we need to do is assign meaningful labels to the different *levels* of each factor. We can do that like this:

```{r}
levels(group) <- c("control", "treatment")
levels(gender) <- c("male", "female")
```

Having done this R produces output that seems a lot more readable...

```{r}
group
gender
```

And when I try to make insane comparisons it tells me to feel bad about myself...

```{r, error=TRUE}
group==gender
```
            
Factors are very useful things, and we’ll use them a lot in this book: they’re the main way to represent a nominal scale variable. And there are lots of nominal scale variables out there. I’ll talk more about factors later, but for now you know enough to be able to get started.

## Data frames

It’s now time to go back and deal with the somewhat confusing thing that happened earlier when we tried to open up a CSV file. Apparently we succeeded in loading the data, but it came to us in a very odd looking format. At the time, I told you that this was a **data frame**. Now I’d better explain what that means.

### Introducing data frames

In order to understand why R has created this funny thing called a data frame, it helps to try to see what problem it solves. So let’s go back to the little scenario that I used when introducing factors in the last. In that section I recorded the `group` and `gender` for all 9 participants in my study, as well as their average `RT` on some task. 

So there are these three variables in the workspace, `gender`, `group` and `RT`. And it just so happens that all three are the same size (i.e., they’re all vectors with 9 elements). Aaaand it just so happens that `gender[1]` corresponds to the gender of the first person, and `RT[1]` is the response time of that very same person, etc. In other words, you and I both know that all these variables correspond to the same data set, and they are organised in exactly the same way.

However, R doesn’t know this! As far as it’s concerned, there’s no reason why the `RT` variable has to be the same length as the `gender` variable; and there’s no particular reason to think that `RT[1]` has any special relationship to `gender[1]` any more than it has a special relationship to `gender[4]`. In other words, when we store everything in separate variables like this, R doesn’t know anything about the relationships between things. It doesn’t even really know that these variables actually refer to a proper data set. The data frame fixes this: if we store our variables inside a data frame, we’re telling R to treat these variables as a single, fairly coherent data set.

To see how they do this, let’s create one. So how do we create a data frame? One way we’ve already seen: if we import our data from a CSV file, R will store it as a data frame. A second way is to create it directly from some existing variables using the `data.frame` function. All you have to do is type a list of variables that you want to include in the data frame. The output of a `data.frame` command is, well, a data frame. So, if I want to store the variables from my experiment in a data frame called `exp` I can do so like this:

```{r}
exp <- data.frame(group, gender, RT)
exp
```

Note that `exp` is a completely self-contained variable. Once you’ve created it, it no longer depends on the original variables from which it was constructed. That is, if we make changes to the original `RT` variable, it will not lead to any changes to the `RT` data stored in `exp`. So, for the sake of my sanity, let's remove all variables from the workspace *except* for the `exp` data frame:

```{r}
rm(list = objects()[objects() != "exp"])  # ... this is ugly!
who() # but what matters is that it worked...
```

We can verify that the original `RT` variable is gone, because if we try to print it out R gives an error message:
```{r,error=TRUE}
RT
```

### Indexing data frames with `$`

At this point, our workspace contains only the one variable, a data frame called expt. But as we can see when we told R to print the variable out, this data frame contains three variables, each of which has nine observations. So how do we get this information out again? After all, there’s no point in storing information if you don’t use it, and there’s no way to use information if you can’t access it. So let’s talk a bit about how to pull information out of a data frame. As is always the case with R there are several ways to do this. The simplest is to use the `$` operator to point to the variable you’re interested in, like this:

```{r}
exp$RT
```

There’s a lot more that can be said about data frames: they’re fairly complicated beasts, and the longer you use R the more important it is to make sure you really understand them. We’ll talk a lot more about them later.

## Lists

The next kind of data I want to mention are lists. Lists are an extremely fundamental data structure in R, and as you start making the transition from a novice to a savvy R user you will use lists all the time. Most of the advanced data structures in R are built from lists (e.g., data frames are actually a specific type of list), so it’s useful to have a basic understanding of them.

Okay, so what is a list, exactly? Like data frames, lists are just “collections of variables.” However, unlike data frames – which are basically supposed to look like a nice “rectangular” table of data – there are no constraints on what kinds of variables we include, and no requirement that the variables have any particular relationship to one another. In order to understand what this actually means, the best thing to do is create a list, which we can do using the `list` function. If I type this as my command:

```{r}
starks <- list(
  parents = c("Eddard", "Catelyn"),
  children = c("Robb", "Jon", "Sansa", "Arya", "Brandon", "Rickon"),
  alive = 8
)
```

I create a list `starks` that contains a list of the various characters that belong to House Stark in George R. R. Martin's *A Song of Ice and Fire* novels. Because Martin does seem to enjoy killing off characters, the list starts out by indicating that all eight are currently alive (at the start of the books obviously!) and we can update it if need be. When a character dies, I might do this:

```{r}
starks$alive <- starks$alive - 1
starks
```

I can delete whole variables from the list if I want. For instance, I might just give up on the parents entirely:

```{r}
starks$parents <- NULL
starks
```

You get the idea, I hope.

## Data frames revisited

Working with data frames can sometimes be complicated, so I'm going to revisit them again now that we've talked about lists. At it's core, a data frame genuinely is a list, one that just happens to have a special "rectangular" structure. However, this rectangular structure means that in addition to working with it using the `$` operator (as one would do for a list), there are some other possibilities too, based on the fact that a data frame has rows and columns. Let's return to the *In the Night Garden* data set. First, let's construct a data frame, `itng`...

```{r}
load("./data/nightgarden.Rdata")
itng <- data.frame( speaker, utterance )
itng
```

... and we'll assume the goal is to be able to select different subsets of this data set.


### The `subset` function

There are several different ways to subset a data frame in R, some easier than others. I’ll start by discussing the `subset` function, which is probably the conceptually simplest way do it. For our purposes there are three different arguments that you’ll be most interested in:

- `x`. The data frame that you want to subset.
- `subset`. A vector of logical values indicating which cases (rows) of the data frame you want to keep. By default, all cases will be retained.
- `select`. This argument indicates which variables (columns) in the data frame you want to keep. This can either be a list of variable names, or a logical vector indicating which ones to keep, or even just a numeric vector containing the relevant column numbers. By default, all variables will be retained.

Let’s start with an example in which I use all three of these arguments. Suppose that I want to subset the `itng` data frame, keeping only the utterances made by Makka-Pakka. What that means is that I need to use the `select` argument to pick out the `utterance` variable, and I also need to use the `subset` variable, to pick out the cases when Makka-Pakka is speaking (i.e., `speaker == "makka-pakka"`). Therefore, the command I need to use is this:

```{r}
df <- subset( 
  x = itng,
  subset = speaker == "makka-pakka",
  select = utterance 
  )
print( df )
```

The variable `df` here is still a data frame, but it only contains one variable (called `utterance`) and four cases. Notice that the row numbers are the same ones from the *original* data frame. It’s worth taking a moment to briefly explain this. The reason that this happens is that these "row numbers" are actually row names. When you create a new data frame from scratch R will assign each row a fairly boring row name, identical to the row number. However, when you subset the data frame, each row keeps its original row name. This can be quite useful, since – as in the current example – it provides you a visual reminder of what each row in the new data frame corresponds to in the original data frame. However, if it annoys you, you can change the row names using the `rownames` function, or remove them entirely with the `rownames(df) <- NULL` command.

In any case, let’s return to the `subset` function, and look at what happens when we don’t use all three of the arguments. Firstly, suppose that I didn’t bother to specify the `select` argument. Let’s see what happens:

```{r}
subset( 
  x = itng,
  subset = speaker == "makka-pakka" 
)
```

Not surprisingly, R has kept the same cases from the original data set (i.e., rows 7 through 10), but this time it has retained all of the variables from the data frame. Equally unsurprisingly, if I don’t specify the `subset` argument, what we find is that R keeps all of the cases:

```{r}
subset( 
  x = itng,
  select = utterance 
)
```

Again, it’s important to note that this output is still a data frame: it’s just a data frame with only a single variable.

### Brackets I: Rows & columns

Throughout the book so far, whenever I’ve been subsetting a vector I’ve tended use the square brackets `[ ]` to do so. But in the previous section when I started talking about subsetting a data frame I used the `subset` function. As a consequence, you might be wondering whether it is possible to use the square brackets to subset a data frame. The answer, of course, is yes. Not only can you use square brackets for this purpose, as you become more familiar with R you’ll find that this is actually much more convenient than using `subset`. Unfortunately, the use of square brackets for this purpose is somewhat complicated, and there are a few cases that cause some confusion. So be warned: this section is more complicated than it feels like it “should” be. With that warning in place, I’ll try to walk you through it slowly. For this section, I’ll use a slightly different *In the Night Garden* data set, namely the `garden` data frame that is stored in the `nightgarden2.Rdata` file:

```{r}
load( "./data/nightgarden2.Rdata" )
garden
```

As you can see, the `garden` data frame contains three variables and five cases, and this time around I’ve used the `rownames` function to attach slightly verbose labels to each of the cases. Moreover, let’s assume that what we want to do is to pick out rows 4 and 5 (the two cases when Makka-Pakka is speaking), and columns 1 and 2 (variables `speaker` and `utterance`).

How shall we do this? As usual, there’s more than one way. The first way is based on the observation that, since a data frame is rectangular, every element in the data frame has a *row number* and a *column number*. So, if we want to pick out a single element, we have to specify the row number *and* a column number within the square brackets. By convention, the row number comes first. So, for the data frame above, which has five rows and three columns, the numerical indexing scheme looks like this:

```{r,echo=FALSE,results="asis"}
tmp <- matrix(NA, 5, 3)
for(i in 1:5) {
  for(j in 1:3) {
    tmp[i,j] <- paste0("[",i,",",j,"]")
  }
}
rownames(tmp) <- paste("row", 1:5)
colnames(tmp) <- paste("col", 1:3)
print(knitr::kable(tmp))
rm(tmp)
```

If I want the 3rd case of the 2nd variable, what I would type is `garden[3,2]`, and R would print out some output showing that this element corresponds to the utterance `"ee"`. However, let’s hold off from actually doing that for a moment, because there’s something slightly counterintuitive about the specifics of what R does under those circumstances. Instead, let’s aim to solve our original problem, which is to pull out two rows (4 and 5) and two columns (1 and 2). This is fairly simple to do, since R allows us to specify multiple rows and multiple columns. So let’s try that:

```{r}
garden[ 4:5, 1:2 ]
```

Clearly, that’s exactly what we asked for: the output here is a data frame containing two variables and two cases. Note that I could have gotten the same answer if I’d used the `c` function to produce my vectors rather than the `:` operator. That is, the following command is equivalent to the last one:

```{r}
garden[ c(4,5), c(1,2) ]
```

It’s just not as pretty. However, if the columns and rows that you want to keep don’t happen to be next to each other in the original data frame, then you might find that you have to resort to using commands like `garden[ c(2,4,5), c(1,3) ]` to extract them.

A second way to do the same thing is to use the names of the rows and columns. That is, instead of using the row numbers and column numbers, you use the character strings that are used as the labels for the rows and columns. To apply this idea to our `garden` data frame, we would use a command like this:
```{r}
garden[ c("case.4", "case.5"), c("speaker", "utterance") ]
```

Once again, this produces exactly the same output, so I haven’t bothered to show it. Note that, although this version is more annoying to type than the previous version, it’s a bit easier to *read*, because it’s often more meaningful to refer to the elements by their names rather than their numbers. Also note that you don’t have to use the same convention for the rows and columns. For instance, I often find that the variable names are meaningful and so I sometimes refer to them by name, whereas the row names are pretty arbitrary so it’s easier to refer to them by number. In fact, that’s more or less exactly what’s happening with the garden data frame, so it probably makes more sense to use this as the command:
```{r}
garden[ 4:5, c("speaker", "utterance") ]
```
Again, the output is identical.

Finally, both the rows and columns can be indexed using logicals vectors as well. For example, although I claimed earlier that my goal was to extract cases 4 and 5, it’s pretty obvious that what I really wanted to do was select the cases where Makka-Pakka is speaking. So what I could have done is create a logical vector that indicates which cases correspond to Makka-Pakka speaking:

```{r}
garden$speaker == "makka-pakka"
```

As you can see, the 4th and 5th elements of this vector are `TRUE` while the others are `FALSE`. So I can use this vector to select the rows that I want to keep:
```{r}
garden[ garden$speaker == "makka-pakka", c("speaker", "utterance") ]
```
And of course the output is, yet again, the same.

### Brackets II: Some elaborations

There are two fairly useful elaborations on this “rows and columns” approach that I should point out. Firstly, what if you want to keep all of the rows, or all of the columns? To do this, all we have to do is leave the corresponding entry blank, but it is crucial to remember to *keep the comma!* For instance, suppose I want to keep all the rows in the `garden` data, but I only want to retain the first two columns. The easiest way do this is to use a command like this:

```{r}
garden[ , 1:2 ]
```


Alternatively, if I want to keep all the columns but only want the last two rows, I use the same trick, but this time I leave the second index blank. So my command becomes:

```{r}
garden[ 4:5, ]
```

The second elaboration I should note is that it’s still okay to use negative indexes as a way of telling R to delete certain rows or columns. For instance, if I want to delete the 3rd column, then I use this command:

```{r}
garden[ , -3 ]
```


whereas if I want to delete the 3rd row, then I’d use this one:

```{r}
garden[ -3,  ]
```

So that’s nice.

### Brackets III:  “dropping”

At this point some of you might be wondering why I’ve been so terribly careful to choose my examples in such a way as to ensure that the output always has are multiple rows and multiple columns. The reason for this is that I’ve been trying to hide the somewhat curious “dropping” behaviour that R produces when the output only has a single column. I’ll start by showing you what happens, and then I’ll try to explain it. Firstly, let’s have a look at what happens when the output contains only a single row:

```{r}
garden[ 5, ]
```

This is exactly what you’d expect to see: a data frame containing three variables, and only one case per variable. Okay, no problems so far. What happens when you ask for a single column? Suppose, for instance, I try this as a command:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
garden[ , 3 ]
```

Based on everything that I’ve shown you so far, you would be well within your rights to expect to see R produce a data frame containing a single variable and five cases. After all, that is what the `subset` command does in this situation, and it’s pretty consistent with everything else that I’ve shown you so far about how square brackets work. In other words, you should expect to see this:
```{r,echo=FALSE}
garden[,3,drop=FALSE]
```
However, that is emphatically not what happens. What you actually get is this:
```{r}
garden[, 3]
```

That output is not a *data frame at all!* That’s just an ordinary numeric vector containing 5 elements. What’s going on here is that R has “noticed” that the output that we’ve asked for doesn’t really “need” to be wrapped up in a data frame at all, because it only corresponds to a single variable. So what it does is “drop” the output from a data frame *containing* a single variable, “down” to a simpler output that corresponds to that variable. This behaviour is convenient for day to day usage once you’ve become familiar with it – and I suppose that’s the real reason why R does this – but there’s no escaping the fact that it is *deeply* confusing to novices. It’s especially confusing because the behaviour appears only for a very specific case: (a) it only works for columns and not for rows, because the columns correspond to variables and the rows do not, and (b) it only applies to the “rows and columns” version of the square brackets, and not to the `subset` function, or to the “just columns” use of the square brackets (next section). As I say, it’s very confusing when you’re just starting out. For what it’s worth, you can suppress this behaviour if you want, by setting `drop = FALSE` when you construct your bracketed expression. That is, you could do something like this:
```{r}
garden[, 3, drop=FALSE]
```
I suppose that helps a little bit, in that it gives you some control over the dropping behaviour, but I’m not sure it helps to make things any easier to understand. Anyway, that’s the “dropping” special case. Fun, isn’t it?

### Brackets IV: Columns only


As if the weird “dropping” behaviour wasn’t annoying enough, R actually provides a completely different way of using square brackets to index a data frame. Specifically, if you *only* give a single index, R will assume you want the corresponding columns, not the rows. Do not be fooled by the fact that this second method also uses square brackets: it behaves differently to the “rows and columns” method that I’ve discussed in the last few sections. Let’s start with the following command:

```{r}
garden[ 1:2 ]
```


As you can see, the output gives me the first two columns, much as if I’d typed `garden[,1:2]`. It doesn’t give me the first two rows, which is what I’d have gotten if I’d used a command like `garden[1:2,]`. Not only that, if I ask for a single column, R does not drop the output:

```{r}
garden[3]
```

As I said earlier, the only case where dropping occurs by default is when you use the “row and columns” version of the square brackets, and the output happens to correspond to a single column. However, if you really want to force R to drop the output, you can do so using the “double brackets” notation:

```{r}
garden[[3]]
```

Note that R will only allow you to ask for one column at a time using the double brackets. If you try to ask for multiple columns in this way, you get completely different behaviour, which may or may not produce an error, but definitely won’t give you the output you’re expecting. The only reason I’m mentioning it at all is that you might run into double brackets when doing further reading, and a lot of books don’t explicitly point out the difference between `[ ]` and `[[ ]]`. 

### Whyyyyy?

Okay, for those few readers that have persevered with this section long enough to get here without having set fire to somethin, I should explain why R has these two different systems for subsetting a data frame (i.e., “row and column” versus “just columns”), and why they behave so differently to each other. I’m not 100% sure about the motivation since I never did manage to read through very much of the  references that describe the early development of R, but I think the answer relates to the fact that data frames are actually a very strange hybrid of two different kinds of thing. At a low level, a data frame is a *list*. I can demonstrate this to you by overriding the normal `print` function and forcing R to print out the garden data frame using the default print method (see later!) rather than the special one that is defined only for data frames. Here’s what we get:

```{r}
print.default( garden )

Apart from the weird part of the output right at the bottom, this is identical to the print out that you get when you print out a list. In other words, a data frame *is* a list. View from this “list based” perspective, it’s clear what `garden[1]` is: it’s the first variable stored in the list, namely `speaker`. In other words, when you use the “just columns” way of indexing a data frame, using only a single index, R assumes that you’re thinking about the data frame as if it were a list of variables. In fact, when you use the `$` operator you’re taking advantage of the fact that the data frame is secretly a list.

However, a data frame is more than just a list. It’s a very special kind of list where all the variables are of the same length, and the first element in each variable happens to correspond to the first “case” in the data set. That’s why no-one ever wants to see a data frame printed out in the default “list-like” way that I’ve shown in the extract above. In terms of the deeper meaning behind what a data frame is used for, a data frame really does have this rectangular shape to it:

```{r}
print( garden )
```

Because of the fact that a data frame is basically a table of data, R provides a second “row and column” method for interacting with the data frame. This method makes much more sense in terms of the "table of data" interpretation of what a data frame is, and so for the most part it’s this method that people tend to prefer. Throughout this tutorial I'll aim to stick to the “row and column” approach (though I will use `$` a lot), and avoid referring to the “just columns” approach. However, it does get used a lot in practice, so I think it’s important that this book explain what’s going on.

And now let us never speak of this again.

## Matrices

Up to this point we have encountered several different kinds of variables. At the simplest level, we’ve seen numeric data, logical data and character data. However, we’ve also encountered some more complicated kinds of variables, namely factors, formulas, data frames and lists. There are many more specialised data structures out there, but there’s a few more generic ones that I want to talk about in passing.

The first of these is a **matrix**. Much like a data frame, a matrix is basically a big rectangular table of data, and in fact there are quite a few similarities between the two. However, there are also some key differences, so it’s important to talk about matrices in a little detail. To start with, lets create a matrix using the "row bind" function, `rbind`, which you can use to combine multiple vectors together in a row-wise fashion (I'm sure you can guess what the column bind function `cbind` does)...

```{r}
row.1 <- c( 2,3,1 )         # create data for row 1
row.2 <- c( 5,6,7 )         # create data for row 2
M <- rbind( row.1, row.2 )  # row bind them into a matrix
print(M)                    # and print it out...
```

The variable `M` is a matrix, which we can confirm by using the `class` function. Notice that, when we bound the two vectors together, R retained the names of the original variables as row names. We could delete these if we wanted by typing `rownames(M)<-NULL`, but I generally prefer having meaningful names attached to my variables, so I’ll keep them. In fact, let’s also add some highly unimaginative column names as well:

```{r}
colnames(M) <- c( "col.1", "col.2", "col.3" )
print(M)
```

### Matrix indexing

You can use square brackets to subset a matrix in much the same way that you can for data frames, again specifying a row index and then a column index. For instance, `M[2,3]` pulls out the entry in the 2nd row and 3rd column of the matrix (i.e., `7`), whereas `M[2,]` pulls out the entire 2nd row, and `M[,3]` pulls out the entire 3rd column. However, it’s worth noting that when you pull out a column, R will print the results horizontally, not vertically.^[The reason for this relates to how matrices are implemented. The original matrix `M` is treated as a *two-dimensional* object, containing two rows and three columns. However, whenever you pull out a single row or a single column, the result is considered to be a vector, which has a *length* but doesn't have dimensions. Unless you explictly coerce the vector into a matrix, R doesn't really distinguish between row vectors and column vectors. This has implications for how matrix algebra is implemented in R (which I’ll admit I initially found odd). When multiplying a matrix by a vector using the `%*%` operator, R will attempt to interpret the vector as either a row vector or column vector, depending on whichever one makes the multiplication work. That is, suppose $\mathbf{M}$ is  $2\times 3$ matrix, and $v$ is a $1\times 3$ row vector. Mathematically the matrix multiplication $\mathbf{M}v$ doesn't make sense since the dimensions don’t conform, but you can multiply by the corresponding column vector, $\mathbf{M}v^T$. So, if I set `v <- M[2,]` and then try to calculate `M %*% v`, which you’d think would fail, it actually works because R treats the one dimensional array as if it were a column vector for the purposes of matrix multiplication. Note that if both objects are one dimensional arrays/vectors, this leads to ambiguity since $vv^T$ (inner product) and $v^Tv$ (outer product) yield different answers. In this situation, the `%*%` operator returns the inner product not the outer product. To understand all the details, check out the help documentation.]
There is also a way of referring to the elements of a matrix using a single index:
```{r}
M <- matrix(
  data = 1:12, # the values to include in the matrix
  nrow = 3,    # number of rows
  ncol = 4     # number of columns
)
print(M)
```
This is a $3\times 4$ matrix `M` that contains the numbers 1 to 12 in order, listed columnwise. You can index the elements of `M` by referring to them in that same columnwise order. To see this, notice that these two commands both extract the same element of the matrix:
```{r}
print(M[2,2]) 
print(M[5])
```


### Matrices vs data frames

The critical difference between a data frame and a matrix is that, in a data frame, we have this notion that each of the columns corresponds to a different variable: as a consequence, the columns in a data frame can be of different data types. The first column could be numeric, and the second column could contain character strings, and the third column could be logical data. In that sense, there is a fundamental asymmetry build into a data frame, because of the fact that columns represent variables (which can be qualitatively different to each other) and rows represent cases (which cannot). Matrices are different. At a fundamental level, a matrix really is just *one* variable: it just happens that this one variable is formatted into rows and columns. If you want a matrix of numeric data, every single element in the matrix *must* be a number. If you want a matrix of character strings, every single element in the matrix *must* be a character string. If you try to mix data of different types together, then R will either complain or try to coerce the matrix into something unexpected. To give you a sense of this, let's do something silly and convert one element of `M` from the number `5` to the character string `"five"`...
```{r}
M[2,2] <- "five" 
print(M)
```
As you can see, the *entire* matrix `M` has been coerced into text. 

## Arrays

When doing data analysis, we often have reasons to want to use higher dimensional tables (e.g., sometimes you need to cross-tabulate three variables against each other). You can’t do this with matrices, but you can do it with arrays. An **array** is just like a matrix, except it can have more than two dimensions if you need it to. In fact, as far as R is concerned a matrix is just a special kind of array, in much the same way that a data frame is a special kind of list. I don’t want to talk about arrays too much, but I will very briefly show you an example of what a three dimensional array looks like.

```{r}
A <- array(
  data = 1:24, 
  dim = c(3,4,2)
  )
print(A)
```

### Array indexing

Not surprisingly, you can refer the elements of an array using the same kind of logic that we used for matrices. In this case, since `A` is a three-dimensional $3 \times 4 \times 2$ array, we need three indices to specify an element,
```{r}
A[2,3,1]
```
but you probably won't be surprised to note that this also works...
```{r}
A[8]
```

### Array names

As with other data structures, arrays can have names for specific elements. In fact, we can assign names to each of the *dimensions* too. For instance, suppose that the array `A` has the shape that it does because it represents a (3 genders) $\times$ (4 seasons) $\times$ (2 times) structure. We could specify the dimension names for `A` like this:
```{r}
A <- array(
  data = 1:24, 
  dim = c(3,4,2), 
  dimnames = list(
    "genders" = c("male", "female", "nonbinary"),
    "seasons" = c("summer", "autumn", "winter", "spring"),
    "times" = c("day", "night")
    )
  )
print(A)
```
I find this a lot easier to read - it's usually a good idea to label your arrays! Plus, it makes it a little easier to index them too, since (as usual) you can refer to elements by names. So if I just wanted to take a slice through the array corresponding to the `"nonbinary"` values, I could do this:
```{r}
A["nonbinary",,]
```

## Ordered factors

One topic that I neglected to mention when discussing factors earlier in this chapter is that there are actually two different types of factor in R, unordered factors and **ordered factors**. An unordered factor corresponds to a nominal scale variable, and all of the factors we’ve discussed so far in this book have been unordered. However, it’s sometimes useful to explicitly tell R that your variable is ordinal scale, and if so you need to declare it to be an ordered factor. For instance, suppose we have a variable consisting of Likert scale data:

```{r}
likert <- c(1, 7, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2, 6, 5, 5)
```

We can declare this to be an ordered factor in by using the `factor` function, and setting `ordered = TRUE`. To illustrate how this works, let’s create an ordered factor called `likert.ordinal` and have a look at it:

```{r}
likert.ordinal <- factor( 
  x = likert,                 # the raw data
  levels = c(7,6,5,4,3,2,1),  # strongest agreement is 1, weakest is 7
  ordered = TRUE              # and it’s ordered
)
print(likert.ordinal)
```

Notice that when we print out the ordered factor, R explicitly tells us what order the levels come in. Because I wanted to order my levels in terms of *increasing* strength of endorsement, and because a response of 1 corresponded to the strongest agreement and 7 to the strongest disagreement, it was important that I tell R to encode 7 as the lowest value and 1 as the largest. Always check this when creating an ordered factor: it’s very easy to accidentally encode your data “upside down” if you’re not paying attention. In any case, note that we can (and should) attach meaningful names to these factor levels by using the `levels` function, like this:
```{r}
levels( likert.ordinal ) <- c( 
  "strong.disagree", "disagree", "weak.disagree",
  "neutral", "weak.agree", "agree", "strong.agree" 
)
print( likert.ordinal )
```

One nice thing about using ordered factors is that there are analyses for which R automatically treats ordered factors differently from unordered factors, and generally in a way that is more appropriate for ordinal data. However, I won’t go into details here. Like so many things in this chapter, my main goal here is to make you aware that R has this capability built into it; so if you ever need to start thinking about ordinal scale variables in more detail, you have at least some idea where to start looking!

## Dates and times

Times and dates are very annoying types of data. To a first approximation we can say that there are 365 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, but that’s not quite correct. The length of the solar day is not exactly 24 hours, and the length of solar year is not exactly 365 days, so we have a complicated system of corrections that have to be made to keep the time and date system working. On top of that, the measurement of time is usually taken relative to a local time zone, and most (but not all) time zones have both a standard time and a daylight savings time, though the date at which the switch occurs is not at all standardised. So, as a form of data, times and dates are just awful to work with. Unfortunately, they’re also important. Sometimes it’s possible to avoid having to use any complicated system for dealing with times and dates. Often you just want to know what year something happened in, so you can just use numeric data: in quite a lot of situations something as simple as delcaring that `this.year` is `r format(Sys.Date(),"%Y")`, and it works just fine. If you can get away with that for your application, this is probably the best thing to do. However, sometimes you really do need to know the actual date. Or, even worse, the actual time. In this section, I’ll very briefly introduce you to the basics of how R deals with date and time data. As with a lot of things in this chapter, I won’t go into details: the goal here is to show you the basics of what you need to do if you ever encounter this kind of data in real life. And then we’ll all agree never to speak of it again.

To start with, let’s talk about the date. As it happens, modern operating systems are very good at keeping track of the time and date, and can even handle all those annoying timezone issues and daylight savings pretty well. So R takes the quite sensible view that it can just ask the operating system what the date is. We can pull the date using the `Sys.Date` function:

```{r}
today <- Sys.Date()  # ask the operating system for the date
print(today)         # display the date
```

Okay, that seems straightforward. But, it does rather look like today is just a character string, doesn’t it? That would be a problem, because dates really do have a quasi-numeric character to them, and it would be nice to be able to do basic addition and subtraction with them. Well, fear not. If you type in `class(today)`, R will tell you that the `today` variable is a `"Date"` object. What this means is that, hidden underneath this text string, R has a numeric representation.^[Date objects are coded internally as the number of days that have passed since January 1, 1970.] What that means is that you  can in fact add and subtract days. For instance, if we add `1` to `today`, R will print out the date for tomorrow:
```{r}
today + 1
```
Let’s see what happens when we add 365 days:
```{r}
today + 365
```
R provides a number of functions for working with dates, but I don’t want to talk about them in any detail. I will, however, make passing mention of the `weekdays` function which will tell you what day of the week a particular date corresponded to, which is extremely convenient in some situations:
```{r}
weekdays(today)
```
I’ll also point out that you can use the `as.Date` to coerce various different kinds of data into dates. If the data happen to be strings formatted exactly according to the international standard notation (i.e., `yyyy-mm-dd`) then the conversion is straightforward, because that’s the format that R expects to see by default. You can convert dates from other formats too, but it’s slightly trickier, and something I won't go into here.

What about times? Well, times are even more annoying than dates, so much so that I don’t intend to talk about them at all right now, other than to point you in the direction of some vaguely useful things. R itself does provide you with tools for handling time data, and in fact there are two separate classes of data that are used to represent times, known by the odd names `POSIXct` and `POSIXlt`. You can use these to work with times if you want to, but for most applications you would probably be better off downloading the `chron` package, which provides some much more user friendly tools for working with times and dates.
