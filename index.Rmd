Hi! Welcome to the **psyr** homepage!

I've set this up as an introductory resource for psychology students taking my "Programming with R" class at UNSW. The intention behind this resource is to provide a fairly detailed introduction to R programming that doesn't assume any previous experience (in Part 1), and then to sketch out a variety of things that you can do with R once you start to feel comfortable with it (in Part 2). This is the first time I've taught this class, so the resources are being put together as I go, and there might be errors - please don't hesitate to contact me at d.navarro@unsw.edu.au if you spot an error or find something confusing. 

A lot of the content borrows heavily from the introdutory statistics lecture notes I wrote ([Learning Statistics with R](http://www.compcogscisydney.com/learning-statistics-with-r.html)), but they're not quite equivalent. I wrote the **lsr** notes to satisfy an immediate teaching need some years back, but I've never really been very pleased with them. The **psyr** resource is my first attempt at revisiting **lsr** in a more satisfying way. Hopefully it is useful! 

## Part 1: Fundamentals

- Chapter 1: [Getting started](./starting.html)
- Chapter 2: [Core concepts](./concepts.html)
- Chapter 3: [R data types](./data.html)

## Part 2: Applications

- Chapter 4: [Drawing plots](./graphs.html)
- Chapter 5: [Probability distributions](./distributions.html)
- Chapter 6: [Introductory stats](./introstats.html)
- Chapter 7: [Shiny apps](./shiny.html)
- Chapter 8: [Miscellaneous](./misc.html)

## Topics I want to add

- Cognitive modelling
- Data manipulation
- Basic text processing & regular expressions
- Graphics with [ggplot](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- Fancier statistics
- Bayesian data analysis (rstanarm, shinystan, bayesfactor)
- RMarkdown, knitr & pandoc (& jupyter notebooks)
- Prettiness with [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/index.html)
- Archiving code with github, osf (& codeocean)
