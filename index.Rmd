Hi there!

I've set this up as an introductory resource for psychology students taking my *Programming with R* class at UNSW. The intention behind this resource is -- eventually -- to provide a fairly detailed introduction to R programming that doesn't assume any previous experience, and then to sketch out a variety of things that you can do with R once you start to feel comfortable with it. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you spot an error or find something confusing.

The content borrows heavily from my introductory statistics lecture notes ([Learning Statistics with R](https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/)), but they're not quite equivalent, and over time the two are likely to part ways. I wrote *Learning Statistics with R* to accompany an introductory statistics class that I taught from 2011 to 2015, and the intended audience for that book is a psych student taking their first research methods class. This resource is a little different -- it's aimed at someone who has already taken an introductory research methods class of some kind, but would like to learn how to use the R programming language for their data analysis, or for any of a number of other possible tasks.
