Hi there!

I've set this up as an introductory resource for psychology students taking my *Programming with R* class at UNSW. There are two goals with this resource. The first is to provide an introduction to R programming that doesn't assume any previous experience. The second is to provide a brief sketch of some of things that R can be useful for in psychology. Data analysis inevitably forms a large part of this, but I hope to cover a broader range of topics.

The content borrows from my introductory statistics lecture notes ([Learning Statistics with R](https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/)), but they're not equivalent, and over time the two are likely to part ways. I wrote *Learning Statistics with R* to accompany an introductory statistics class that I taught some years ago, and the intended audience for that book is a psych student taking their first research methods class. This resource is a little different -- it's aimed at someone who has taken an research methods class and would like to learn how to use the R programming language in their own work.

It is of course a work in progress, but I hope it is useful! Please don't hesitate to contact me if you spot an error or find something confusing.
